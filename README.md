# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge Richard Soos
This project creates a linear regression model against bank account data
The aim is to identify the Risk of Default  as a binary identifier (0 safe, 1 at High Risk of Default). A confusion matrix and a classification report are generated after a testing sample size and model have been chosen.
There is discussion at the end of the Jupyter Notebook on the usability of our model
Please run the python program in the same directory that the Resources folder is placed in.
